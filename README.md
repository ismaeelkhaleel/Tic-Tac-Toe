Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where two players take turns marking the spaces with "X" and "O". The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all the cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

This project focuses on implementing the game logic, UI interactions, and winning/draw conditions using vanilla JavaScript. It also includes a feature to restart the game after completion.
